# The Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface for all class which was inherited it
# Like the example in previous session
# So, I'll create the base class with the base method (but cannot implement)
# When the child class inherits this class, they will implement this methods
# Depend on the child class, the action in this method will be created
# So, in the child class, we don't need define a new method, we only access to this method and implement it
